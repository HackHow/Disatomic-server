## Motivation

I want to create a chat room that automatically stores files and links because primary communication platform is Discord in the training camp, where students and professors frequently share specific technical articles or files, but it happens that when I want to find something, I can't find it easilyÂ in the chat room. It's difficult to access files or Web links that have already been shared.

## Features

- Stored automaitcally files and links in chat room
- Created Workspaces and channels
- Cross-platform desktop applications
- Identified text containing http or https and turn it into a link
- Previewed user-uploaded images
- Real-time notification mechanism

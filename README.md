## Introduction
Disatomic is a chat room that automatically stores files and links, 

I want to create  because the primary communication platform is Discord in the training camp, where students and professors frequently share specific technical articles or files. Still, I can't find something quickly in the chat room when I want to find something. It isn't easy to access files or web links that have already been sent.

## Features
Disatomic provides the following features:

- Stored automaitcally files and links in chat room
- Created Workspaces and channels
- Cross-platform desktop applications
- Identified text containing http or https and turn it into a link
- Previewed user-uploaded images
- Real-time notification mechanism
